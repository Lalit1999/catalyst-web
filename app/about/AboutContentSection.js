            <p>My name is Moni Kumari, a visual artist currently based in Sampla, Haryana, holding a Bachelors and Masters degree in Painting from the College of Art, Delhi. My journey with art began in childhood through drawing and painting as a natural form of expression. Over the years, this hobby evolved into a serious pursuit, leading me to explore art as a way of understanding people, places, and deeper social realities.</p>
            <p>My practice draws from personal experiences and observations—from growing up in Bihar, studying in Delhi, to living in Haryana. During my daily train journeys, I began sketching people, capturing moments of migration, survival, labor, and everyday life. These experiences inspired me to explore themes such as identity, societal hierarchy, emotional depth, and cultural transitions.</p>
            <p>Through various mediums and techniques, I continue to create works that speak of lived experience, emotional truth, and cultural roots—seeking meaning and identity in the movement between places and stories.</p>

            <p className={styles.contentHeading}>Artistic Vision and Style</p>
            <p>My artistic style is rooted in both traditional and experimental approaches. I work across various mediums including acrylic, watercolor, pencil, charcoal, and mixed media—combining detailed drawing with expressive strokes and layered textures. My technique often involves observing closely, sketching spontaneously, and then translating those emotions into thoughtful compositions that reflect the complexity of everyday life.</p>
            <p>My art is driven by a deep need to express the emotions, struggles, and stories I witness in everyday life. Growing up and moving through different places—from Bihar to Delhi to Haryana—I have experienced the complexity of cultural shifts, migration, and survival. These transitions shaped my inner world and continue to fuel my creative process. I am especially drawn to the silent strength of working people, the layered emotions behind ordinary faces, and the invisible systems of power, scarcity, and hope that shape our lives.</p>
            <p>My art is  expressing lived experiences, especially migration, identity, and survival.  I reflect on the emotional and social journeys of working people—capturing their silence, strength, and stories. Central to my work is the recurring symbol of the “चादर” (bedsheet), representing resources, money, opportunity, and dignity. Through this, I explore themes of sufficiency- insufficiency, social hierarchy, memory, and emotional truth. My paintings become visual narratives that question power, reflect on belonging, and give form to the invisible realities of everyday life.</p>

            <p className={styles.contentHeading}>Role of Art in My Life</p>
            <p>Art is both my profession and my personal language of living. It gives me a way to observe, question, and understand the world around me. Personally, it helps me process emotions, reflect on my experiences, and stay connected to my roots. Professionally, it is my voice, my identity, and my way of contributing to larger conversations about society, culture, and human experience. </p>
            <p>I feel deeply connected to a broader community of artists who draw from lived experience, cultural identity, and social observation. My work is rooted in personal and collective narratives, and I often relate to practices that explore migration, identity, and survival. I also engage with local artistic communities and am influenced by the visual traditions of Bihar, as well as contemporary Indian art that bridges the personal with the political.</p>
            <p>When people experience my work, I want them to pause, feel, and reflect. I hope they connect emotionally—with the faces, the stories, the silence, and the tension within the images. My aim is to create a quiet space where viewers can see not just others&apos; lives, but also parts of their own journey - questioning what is enough, who is visible, and how stories of ordinary people are worth being seen and remembered.</p>
